# diceware
Python scripts based on the diceware concept of passkey generation.

<strong>dicemethod.py</strong> - Bust out a six sided die and play the game of life.<br />
<strong>randommethod.py</strong> - Put those cpu cycles to good use and get a fast, secure phrase.<br />
<strong>listmethod.py</strong> - The word list is cut in half by just using a list of words without the numbers that would<br />
have been generated by a die. No dictionaries this time, just a long list of words and random picks<br />
